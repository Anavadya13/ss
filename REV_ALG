Initialization:

MOV AX, DATA: Load the address of the data segment into AX.
MOV DS, AX: Set the data segment register (DS) with the address from AX.
LEA DX, MSG1: Load the address of the string "Enter a string: $" into DX.
MOV AH, 09H: Set up DOS interrupt for printing the string (function 09H).
INT 21H: Call DOS interrupt to display the string prompt.
Input Handling:

LEA SI, STR1: Load the address of STR1 into SI (to track the start of the string).
LEA DI, STR1: Load the address of STR1 into DI (for writing input characters).
Loop to read input:
MOV AH, 01H: Set up for input (DOS interrupt 01H to read a single character).
INT 21H: Read a character and store it in AL.
CMP AL, 0DH: Check if the character is Enter (carriage return, 0DH).
JE TERMINATE: If Enter is pressed, jump to the termination section.
MOV [DI], AL: Store the input character at the location pointed to by DI.
INC DI: Move to the next position in the buffer to store the next character.
JMP NEXT: Repeat to read the next character.
String Termination:

After the user presses Enter:
Append the characters to indicate the end of the string:
MOV AL, "'": Add a single quote at the end.
MOV [DI], AL: Store it in the string.
INC DI: Move the pointer to the next position.
MOV AL, ".": Add a period.
MOV [DI], AL: Store it in the string.
INC DI: Move the pointer.
MOV AL, "$": Add a $ to mark the end of the string for display purposes.
MOV [DI], AL: Store it.
DEC DI: Move DI back to the last valid character (ignoring '."$).
String Reversal:

Set up two pointers:
SI starts from the first character of the string.
DI points to the last valid character of the string.
Loop to swap characters between the start and end:
MOV AL, [SI]: Load the character at SI (the start) into AL.
XCHG AL, [DI]: Swap the character in AL (from the start) with the character at DI (the end).
XCHG AL, [SI]: Swap the AL character back into SI to complete the swap.
INC SI: Move SI forward.
DEC DI: Move DI backward.
CMP SI, DI: Compare if the two pointers have met or crossed.
JL DOTHIS: If SI is less than DI, continue the swapping process.
Display Reversed String:

LEA DX, MSG2: Load the address of the message "The reversed string is '$" into DX.
MOV AH, 09H: Set up DOS interrupt to print the message.
INT 21H: Call DOS interrupt to print the message.
LEA DX, STR1: Load the address of the reversed string (STR1) into DX.
MOV AH, 09H: Set up DOS interrupt to print the reversed string.
INT 21H: Call DOS interrupt to display the reversed string.
Exit:

MOV AH, 4CH: Set up for program termination (DOS interrupt 4CH).
INT 21H: Exit the program.
Summary of Key Operations
Input handling: Reads a string character by character until Enter is pressed.
String reversal: Swaps characters from the start and the end of the string, moving towards the center.
Output: Displays the reversed string.
Exit: Terminates the program.
