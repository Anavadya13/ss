Initialization:

MOV AX, DATA: Load the data segment into AX.
MOV DS, AX: Transfer the data segment address into DS.
LEA DX, MSG1: Load the address of the prompt message into DX.
MOV AH, 09H: Set up interrupt to display string (DOS interrupt 09H).
INT 21H: Call DOS interrupt to print the prompt message.
Input Handling:

LEA SI, STR1: Load the address of STR1 into SI (starting point of the string).
LEA DI, STR1: Load the address of STR1 into DI (we will also use this for writing characters).
Loop to read each character:
MOV AH, 01H: Set up for input (DOS interrupt 01H).
INT 21H: Get a single character from the user.
CMP AL, 0DH: Check if the character is Enter (carriage return, 0DH).
JE TERMINATE: If Enter is pressed, jump to the termination step.
MOV [DI], AL: Store the input character at the location pointed to by DI.
INC DI: Move to the next position in the string buffer.
JMP NEXT: Loop to read the next character.
String Termination:

MOV AL, "$": Store the $ terminator after the last character of the string.
MOV [DI], AL: Set the end of the string with $.
Palindrome Check:

DEC DI: Move DI back to the last valid character (ignoring the $ terminator).
Loop to compare the characters from the start and end of the string:
MOV AL, [SI]: Load the character at the start of the string (pointed by SI) into AL.
CMP [DI], AL: Compare the character at the start (AL) with the character at the end (pointed by DI).
JNE NOTPALINDROME: If they don't match, jump to the not palindrome section.
INC SI: Move SI forward to the next character.
CMP SI, DI: Check if SI has reached or passed DI.
JL DOTHIS: If SI is still less than DI, continue comparing.
Palindrome Result:

If all comparisons match:
PALINDROME label:
MOV AH, 09H: Set up to print the "It is a palindrome" message.
LEA DX, MSG2: Load the message into DX.
INT 21H: Call DOS interrupt to print the message.
Jump to program exit (XX label).
Not Palindrome Result:

If any comparison fails:
NOTPALINDROME label:
MOV AH, 09H: Set up to print the "It is not a palindrome" message.
LEA DX, MSG3: Load the message into DX.
INT 21H: Call DOS interrupt to print the message.
Jump to program exit (XX label).
Exit:

MOV AH, 4CH: Set up for program termination (DOS interrupt 4CH).
INT 21H: Exit the program.
Summary of Key Operations
Input handling: Reads a string character by character until Enter is pressed.
Palindrome check: Compares characters from the start and the end of the string, moving towards the center.
Output: Displays whether the string is a palindrome or not.
Exit: Terminates the program.
